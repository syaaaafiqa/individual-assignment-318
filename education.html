                This journey begin when I was 6 years old, my journey in pra sekolah was filled with excitement and wonder.
                Every morning, I eagerly walked into the cheerful classroom, greeted by the warm smiles of my teachers and 
                classmates. It was a time of discovery, where I learned to read, write, and count through fun activities and
                colorful lessons. I loved the arts and crafts sessions, where my imagination came alive as I painted and 
                created little masterpieces to proudly show my parents. Playing with friends during recess was the highlight 
                of my day, whether it was running around the playground or sharing snacks under the shady trees. 
                Those early years were not just about learning; they were about building friendships, gaining confidence, 
                and laying the foundation for my educational journey. Looking back, pra sekolah was a special chapter that 
                shaped my love for learning and adventure.

                Entering primary school at SK Meru 2 was an exciting new chapter in my life. As a Year 1 student, 
                I was a little nervous but eager to explore the bigger classrooms and meet new friends. I quickly 
                adjusted to the routine, with my days filled with learning, assembly, and recess. Each year brought 
                new challenges and experiences, from mastering Bahasa Melayu and English to tackling mathematics and 
                science. I remember my teachers being patient and encouraging, always ready to guide us through both 
                academics and values.
            </span>
            <p>
                By the time I reached the upper primary years, I was more confident and actively participated in school 
                activities like sports, cultural performances, and classroom projects. My favorite moments were the school
                 competitions, where I pushed myself to excel and make my parents proud. Darjah 6 was particularly 
                 significant as I prepared for the UPSR exams, a milestone that taught me the value of discipline and 
                 perseverance. SK Meru 2 was not just a school; it was a place where I grew, learned life lessons, and 
                 built friendships that I cherish to this day. Those six years shaped my character and prepared me for 
                 the next steps in my educational journey.

                My journey in high school at SMK Meru was a time of growth, discovery, and challenges. 
                Starting as a Form 1 student, I was excited but slightly nervous about entering a new environment. 
                The transition from primary to secondary school meant adjusting to a larger campus, new subjects, and 
                making new friends. Slowly, I found my footing, and the years flew by as I balanced academics with 
                extracurricular activities. From joining school clubs and participating in sports to spending time with 
                friends during recess, high school became a place where I built memories that I still cherish.
            </span>
            <p>
                Form 4 and Form 5 brought a more focused and intense phase as I prepared for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia 
                (SPM), the most important exam in high school. However, the COVID-19 pandemic made these years unlike 
                anything I had experienced before. The sudden shift to online learning was challenging—I had to adapt to 
                virtual classes, manage my own time, and stay motivated despite the uncertainties. It was a strange and 
                isolating period, but it taught me resilience and discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally sitting for the SPM in the midst of the pandemic was surreal. Masked faces, social distancing, 
                and strict SOPs defined the exam experience, but it also made me more determined to do my best. Completing 
                high school during such a turbulent time was an achievement I will always be proud of, and those years at 
                SMK Meru shaped me into the person I am today—stronger, more adaptable, and ready to face new challenges.

                    Currently, I am in the final stretch of my journey as a diploma student in Information Management. 
                    Reflecting on the past semesters, this experience has been both rewarding and challenging, shaping 
                    me academically and personally. From the very first class, I was introduced to the fascinating world 
                    of information systems, records management, and data organization. Each subject deepened my 
                    understanding and passion for this field, making me appreciate how information drives decision-making 
                    in today’s digital age.
                </span>
                <p>
                    The journey wasn’t always smooth—I faced tight deadlines, complex assignments, and demanding projects.
                     Yet, these challenges pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and develop skills like time 
                     management, teamwork, and critical thinking. My internship experience, particularly working in a 
                     medical records office, allowed me to apply what I had learned in real-world settings and see the 
                     importance of efficiency and accuracy in managing information.

                    Now, as a last-semester student, I am filled with mixed emotions. There’s a sense of pride in how 
                    far I’ve come, excitement for the opportunities that lie ahead, and a touch of nervousness as I 
                    prepare for the transition into the professional world. This diploma has not only equipped me with 
                    valuable knowledge but has also given me the confidence to pursue my dreams and carve my own path in 
                    the field of information management.
